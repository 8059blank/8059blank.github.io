##### Due to the current Covid-19 situation, the in-person competition will be postponed to the 2022 March holiday

#### Programme Details

ACtionBots is a fast-paced competition where you can form a team of 2-3 students to build your own 3D printed combat bot to battle in an arena. Robotics Technology Society (RTS) members wil conduct workshops where your team can learn about the basics of building a robot and Arduino in order to construct and program a simple remote-controlled robot. Then, you will face off against other teams to fight for the championship and prize money in a 1v1 tournament.

ACtionBots has 2 categories (based on your level in 2022):

**Junior Category**

* Year 1-3s
* 14 Driver Teams

**Senior Category**

* Year 4-6s
* 14 Driver Teams
* 8 Autonomous Teams

**Awards**

* $100 - Champions of each category (Junior, Senior Driver and Senior Autonomous)
* $50  - Best Strategy Award (Overall)

#### Workshop Details 

RTS will provide all your robot parts as well as video tutorials on how to build and program your robot on the first day of the workshops.  
*Senior teams can design your own 3D printed parts and send the CAD file to RTS for approval and printing (PETG filament).  
Your team can build, program and test your robot while RTS members are present for consultation if you have any questions.  
The workshops will be held during the 2022 March Holidays; exact dates will be given at a later time.
