* [Vuln Hub](https://vulnhub.com)

These resources will help you build a good foundation around the skill-set and critical thinking required to solve CTF challenges. In addition, write-ups on solving challenges in past CTF competitions may be found online. These write-ups would also provide you a good understanding of how CTF challenges may be solved. 
  
Q: What do I need to prepare for the competition?

A: Participants will attempt to earn the most points by solving competition challenges. At the end of the competition, points scored by each team will be added. The tiebreaker will be the time taken to solve the challenge.
