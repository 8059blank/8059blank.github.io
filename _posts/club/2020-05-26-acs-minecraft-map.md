During the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore, schools and workplaces were closed, and students were required to embark on full home-based learning online. In the light of this situation, our Robotics and Technological Society took our ACS(I) campus online, making a virtual rendition of our school in Minecraft. Working for over 3 months to complete this project, we are finally releasing it to our student body, where they were able to explore parts of school they had long missed with classmates. Our club is grateful for this opportunity to give back to the school family and use our creative skills to strengthen our AC bond in spirit while apart.
