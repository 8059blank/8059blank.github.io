Tech Squad specialises in designing and creating tangible products for a wide range of competitions revolving around the theme of technology. We fabricate our products meticulously using computer-aided designs (CAD) and bring them to life with the assistance of 3D-printers. We also prototype and develop a multitude of apps for both iOS and Android. Our responsibilities include running the Digital Makerâ€™s Zone (DMZ) in Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) which is the first student-run hub for innovation and tinkering in Singapore.
