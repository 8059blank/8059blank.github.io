## Why 8059
When the robotics club was set up in 2006, the team competed in the VEX Robotics competition under the team number 8088. Over the years, the number was switched to 8059. It was during this period that the club began to gain recognition on a global stage.

## History of "Blank." and the Robotics Club
Despite being a playful name to be displayed, it was ultimately an expression of the team at the time and the desire to create solutions that were unconventional and pushed boundaries. Over the years, we have developed a reputation for that - being unafraid to face the strongest and most established competitors in various competitions. One of our major competitions is the VEX Robotics World Championship in which teams from all around the world compete for the World Champion title. We have also participated in other competitions such as RoboCup, FIRST Global Challenge and Micromouse.

## Merger of Coding Competition Team
In 2018, the schools Coding Competition Team, then known as the Computer Services Team was merged with the robotics club. This directed the club towards a more software oriented perspective. CCT focuses on the coding related competitions such as hackathons, capture-the-flag competitions and competitive programming.

## Creation of the TechSquad
Established in 2019, the Tech Squad specialises in designing and creating tangible products for a wide range of competitions revolving around the theme of technology. It was formed to run the Digital Makerâ€™s Zone (DMZ) in Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) which is the first student-run hub for innovation and tinkering in Singapore. Our students fabricate products meticulously using computer-aided designs (CAD) and bring them to life with the assistance of 3D-printers. They also prototype and develop a multitude of apps for both iOS and Android.
